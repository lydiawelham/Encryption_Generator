The Encryption Generator is a c programme that allows you to enter a 26 character substitution key, followed by a block of plaintext you would like to encrypt.

I produced this programme as part of Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. All code is my own. 

To run, download substitution.c and enter 

> make substitution 

in the terminal, followed by 

> ./substitution YOUR_26_CHAR_KEY

to run.
